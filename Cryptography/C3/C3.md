# Description
This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!  
Download the ciphertext [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/ciphertext).  
Download the encoder [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/convert.py).  
Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit  
"picoCTF{example}".

# Hints
* Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does.
