# Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!  
Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:63161/), and find the flag!

# Hints
* Try CTRL+U / ⌘+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.
* Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
* What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.
