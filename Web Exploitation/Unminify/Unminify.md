# Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!  
Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:63161/), and find the flag!

# Hints
* Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.
* Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
* What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

# Solution
Open the pico webshell and enter the command `curl <URL from challenge>` then hit enter

Using the curl command allows you to see the page source of the URL you enter.

You'll see there is a big glob of text. Let's make it easier to find by piping the curl results to a grep of the start of the flag.   
Use this command: `curl http://titan.picoctf.net:63512/ | grep "picoCTF{"`

We can see that grep automatically highlights the beginning of the flag for us. We've successfully found the flag!

Flag: `picoCTF{pr3tty_c0d3_d9c45a0b}`
