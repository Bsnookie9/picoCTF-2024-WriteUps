Hit `F12` or right click the page and scroll down to `Inspect` to open the web inspector for the webpage.

From here you can see that the tabs at the top of the webpage give different pages `HOME` `ABOUT` `CONTACT`

Using the web inspector on the different tabs you can see that the `ABOUT` tab has a long string under the header class

The second hint mentions that the flag may or may not be encoded. Let's put this long string into CyberChef and decode it using Base64.

There's the flag!
